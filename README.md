## Notes

I stole the recommendation codes from [Toby Segaran's Programming Collective Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com.tr/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325/) book.

I took the movies dataset from <https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/> and edited it for my needs using MS Excel.
